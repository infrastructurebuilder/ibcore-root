/**
 *
 * This is an artifact meta-resolver. It is meant to supply artifacts based on a signature, but does not specify where
 * those artifacts should come from. That is the pervue of the underlying "resolver".
 *
 * REQUIREMENT: The primary contract of this interface is that if a pre-resolved artifact path is available in the
 * source param, then the source parameter is returned unchanged as the result.
 *
 * REQUIREMENT: If the resolver cannot resolve the path, then Optional.empty() is the correct return result.
 *
 * A resolver has some internal (but undefined) understanding of where to look for the artifact bytestream. It then maps
 * the GAV from the supplied GAV param and returns that same GAV but with the file path set to that stream of bytes.
 *
 * This obviously means that any implementation requires access to a file that may not yet exist. The impl would need to
 * acquire that file in order to set the path in the resultant GAV.
