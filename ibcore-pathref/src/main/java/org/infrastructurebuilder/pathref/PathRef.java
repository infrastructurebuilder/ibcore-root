/**
 * A PathRef is an object that holds some base location as the base location of filesystem or filesystem-like
 * collection.
 *
 * Some persisted things, like ChecksumBuilder and JSONBuilder, accept a PathRef and strip off the prefix from absolute
 * paths so that the persisted values remain portable.
 *
 * A PathRef's job is to ensure that files may be <i>read</i> from within the context of the object using only a Path.
 *
 *
 * The PathRef helps to solve a problem of checksumming values that have paths baked into them. It allows us to manage
 * any number of filesystem objects as relative paths from some PathRef, and thus as long as the root is set to the same
 * value those streams should be the same streams in the future. So if the path of an object is part of its checksum,
 * then we can just relativize the path everything off the PathRef.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * It is possible that at some point we will make PathRef values into a Java FileSystem object, allowing us to treat
 * everything as 'absolute' within the root area.<br/>
 * Uses:
 * <ul>
 * <li>First and foremost, a PathRef is a pointer to some named tree of information.</li>
 * <li>A PathRef may be used to acquire an InputStream or a Reader using a <i>RELATIVE</i>
 * <code>java.nio.Path</code></li>
 * <li>Sometimes, a PathRef can be used to get a permanant or temporary file</li>
 * <li>Sometimes, a PathRef can be used as the root to a FileSystem-like construct.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Requirements:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A PathRef must be constructed from a string.</li>
 *
 * <li>A root <i>cannot be <code>null</code></i>. A null value is not applicable as a root. However, most RRs is viewed
 * as an Optional, in which case the consumer is expected to accept that there actually is no root</li>
 * <ol>
 * </ol>
 * <li>A <code>PathRef</code> may point to a read-only location</li>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Not all PathRef instances are locations for writing.</li>
 * <li>Not all writeable PathRefs would be writable using the PathRef itself.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <li>A root <b>may</b> be a <code>Path</code> <i>to a filesystem directory</i></li>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The Path must be an absolute path (i.e. <code>Path.toAbsolutePath()</code>)</li>
 * <li>Any relativization or resolution must be <b><i>within the path</i></b>.</li>
 * <li>Relative links </i><b>must not</b> travel outside the root path</i>.<br/>
 * This means that any item within a relative root may not pass above the "root base" and must never refer to anything
 * outside of the defined root path.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <li>A root <b>may</b> be a <code>Path</code> <i>to a filesystem-backed archive file</i></li>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The file must be an <i>absolute path</i> to a ZipFileSystem-readable archive</li>
 * <li>Such an archive is generally going to be considered read-only (at least for now></li>
 * <li>All data will be read from the archive as if it were a ZipFilesystem item (i.e
 * <code>/path/to/filename.zip!some/path/inside.txt</code>)</li>
 * </ol>
 * <li>A root may be a <code>java.net.URI</code></li>
 * <ol>
 * <li>URI and URL might be used interchangeably in this documentation, but they're not identical.</li>
 * <li>File paths are commuted to their URI equivalent and then externalized.</li>
 * <li>This actually means that all Path objects are really URI-backed, for reading purposes.</li>
 * <li>Since a URI is sometimes more "outside of the control" of the local system (usually), it is possible that some
 * relocation might be problematic.</li>
 * <li>Since URL (thus URI) <code>scheme</code>'s are loaded at runtime, it is possible that a reconstituted runtime
 * would have different schemes available to it. For instance, one might have a <code>java.net.URLStreamHandler</code>
 * for S3, such that <code>s3://blahblahblah</code> pointed to a viable URL location. When that is persisted, but then
 * later the runtime didn't have access to that <code>URLStreamHandler</code> for whatever reason, the underlying
 * system's integrity would not be damaged but access definitely would be.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <li>A root may be a URL-like string, such as a cloud provider blobstore endpoint url
 * <ol>
 * <li>A "URL-like" means that the implementation of whatever IB-based code exists is going to handle the transfers for
 * us, much in the manner of a <code>URLStreamHandler</code>.</li>
 * <li>However, unlike above, there must be application logic that interprets the string so that configuration is
 * simpler.</li>
 * <li>Either way has advantages. It is expected that most PathRefs will be filesystem paths or paths to URLs that have
 * stream handlers associated with them. Cloud provided blobstores are the most likely targets in that case</li>
 * </ol>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Generally, the URL or the Path implementation is the correct one. Those are loaded at runtime by default, and thus
 * always available.
